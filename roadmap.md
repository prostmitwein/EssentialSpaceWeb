# Roadmap

This document outlines the future development path for **EssentialSpaceWeb**. The goal is to enhance utility while strictly adhering to the "Essential" minimalist philosophy.

## Phase 1: Essentials & Polish
Focus on core usability and data management.

- [ ] **Data Export/Import**: Implement JSON export and import functionality to allow users to backup and restore their data.
- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Add a real-time search bar to filter notes by content, not just tags.
- [ ] **Markdown Support**: Enable basic markdown rendering for `[NOTE]` types (bold, italics, lists).

## Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality
Add powerful features that respect the user's attention.

- [ ] **PWA Support**: Add a Service Worker and Web App Manifest to make the app installable and offline-capable.
- [ ] **Voice Memos**: Implement actual audio recording storage (using Blobs) for a new `[AUDIO]` type or as an attachment to notes.
- [ ] **Drag & Drop**: Allow users to manually reorder pinned notes and widgets.

## Phase 3: Customization
Allow users to make the space their own without breaking the design system.

- [.] **Theme Engine**: Add a toggle for Light/Dark mode and allow selection of a custom accent color (replacing the default red).
- [ ] **Custom Widgets**: Enable users to toggle widget visibility or add simple new ones (e.g., a countdown timer).
